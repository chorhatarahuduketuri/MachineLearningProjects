Objectives: 
1. Create model to classify different species types
2. Write up what you did, produce graphs to show results
3. Put on github page 

1. 
- randomise order of data prior to split 
- use 120/30 training/test split
- use logistic regression
- check results

2. 
a) First, I wrote this plan 
b) Imported the iris dataset
c) Learned how to use numpy.column_stack to put the training samples ane the targets together, so the data's ordering could be randomised prior to training/test set separation. 
d) Created four separate data structures; I decided to split the data 80:20, since the full dataset is of 150 samples, made up with 50 of each class, I created a training set of the first 120 samples (from the randomly reordered dataset, to ensure the model would be trained on all 3 classes), and another set of the classes for those 120 samples. I then created a test set from the remaining 30 samples, along with the target set for those. 
e) Then, I made the Logistic Regression classifier, setting the parameters to carry out a max of 500 iterations (more than enough), to use the lbfgs algorithm, because it was the only one I'd heard of from this list, and to provide a verbose output, because I wanted to know what it would tell me. 
f) I provided the classifier with the training data sets of samples and target classes, and let it do it's thing (took less than a second). 
g) Checked how well the model had learned the data by using the test data set. 
h) Turns out he verbose parameter means it tells you how long it took to learn.
